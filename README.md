# DemocrApp
_Due to the recent political events in the different countries of South America, the government has selected a group of students from the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru from the TEL306 class to develop an app that contributes to the preservation of democracy. With this application, the citizens will be asked various questions so that the decision that are made, they are according to popular consensus._

## API REST 📋
